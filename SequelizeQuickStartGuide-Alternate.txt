sequelize-cli alternate instructions
NOTE: As of Th night, the latest sequelize and sequelize-cli (v6.1.1 pushed Th night) appear to be broken :(
Use these steps to install an older version of sequelize and sequelize-cli instead.
The examples/activities in GitLab all use version 4. Version 5 seems to work OK too.
Follow these steps (instead of the PDF document) for activity 6.
npm install mysql2
npm install sequelize@^5 
npm install sequelize-cli@^5
npx sequelize init:models
npx sequelize init:config
Then continue with Part 2 of the PDF - SequelizeQuickStart.PDF
